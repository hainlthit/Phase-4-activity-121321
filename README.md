>Note: if you get stuck review Active Model Serializer

You've been hired to create a Game Review app. It will have a React client and Rails api. 

1. Add Active Model Serializer to the gemfile and bundle.

         <img src="assets/gem_AMS.png"
        alt="gem ams"
        style="margin-right: 10px;" />
      <hr/>
 </details>

2. Generate a serializer for every model.

      <hr/>
      rails g serializer game
      </br>
      rails g serializer review
        </br>
      rails g serializer user
      <hr/>
 </details>


3. Customize each serializer.
  - Add specific attributes, exclude things like id  created_at.
  - Add at least one customized attribute, for example format price to have a $ and two decimal points 
  - Add an association, use has_many or belongs_to to add one of the associated values. 
  - Test your serializer with the browser or postman. If you haven't already done so, add the index/show action to the controller of the model your testing.
